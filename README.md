streamlit run src/main.py  
The app will launch at: http://localhost:8501

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Sign up / log in (accounts stored in Supabase).  
Create a new analysis session.  
Upload a medical report (PDF) - AI generates analysis.  
View personalized recommendations & save history.

## Example Demo

- Uploading a CBC report - AI highlights potential risks.
- Lipid profile upload - AI suggests lifestyle changes.
- Supports chat-like health Q&A with Generative AI.

### Security & Privacy

## üìå Future Improvements.
To make MediPath-AI even more impactful, here are planned future improvements and features:

1. Multilingual Support.  
Expand communication beyond English to include Swahili, French, and local mother tongues, improving accessibility for diverse communities.

2. Domain-Specialist Medical Knowledge. 
Enhance AI prompts with curated knowledge bases and specialist-driven datasets for more accurate and context-aware medical insights.

3. Role-Specific Dashboards.  
Build customized interfaces for patients, nurses, and doctors, enabling each role to view relevant information and actions tailored to their needs.


4. Offline-First Mode.  
Introduce local caching and fallback models to allow healthcare workers to continue using the app in areas with poor or intermittent internet connectivity.
