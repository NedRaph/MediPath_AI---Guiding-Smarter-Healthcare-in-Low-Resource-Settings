# Guiding Smarter Healthcare in Low-Resource Settings

### Note: This Project is still in its development stages

## üìñ Overview

MediPath AI is an AI-powered multilingual healthcare assistant designed to support patients, nurses, and doctors in low-resource settings. 
The platform leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Generative AI and knowledge-driven pipelines to provide accessible medical insights, decision support, and personalized health guidance.

By integrating lightweight deployment strategies and offline-first features, MediPath AI aims to bridge the healthcare gap for underserved communities, empowering frontline workers and patients with reliable, contextualized information.

## üéØ Objective

To build an AI-enabled healthcare assistant that supports multilingual communication between patients and medical staff. 
To provide intelligent analysis of medical records and test results with actionable recommendations. 
To enable low-bandwidth, low-resource usage, making healthcare insights accessible in underserved regions. 
To ensure security, privacy, and trustworthiness in handling sensitive health data.

## ü©∏ Problem Statement
Millions of people in low-resource settings face challenges such as: 
- Limited access to healthcare professionals due to shortages. 
- Language barriers that hinder communication between patients and providers. 
- Inadequate digital infrastructure, making most modern health solutions unusable. 
- Delayed diagnosis and treatment, especially for chronic or preventable conditions. 

MediPath AI seeks to address these challenges by offering a multilingual, lightweight, and secure AI-driven solution that bridges the healthcare access gap.

### (Proposed Approach)

## üî¨ Methodology

The MediPath AI system will be built around an agent-based architecture with the following key components: 
1. Data Processing & Knowledge Base. 
Collects and preprocesses medical reports, patient histories, and community health data. 
Builds a knowledge base for in-context, role-specific health guidance.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Enables multilingual text and voice inputs (patients, nurses, doctors). 
Supports question-answering and symptom-based guidance.

3. AI Models & Reasoning. 
Multi-model cascade system for report analysis, summarization, and recommendations. 
In-context learning to improve advice based on previous interactions.

4. Interface & User Access.
Mobile-friendly and responsive UI designed for community health workers. 
Role-based access for patients, nurses, and doctors. 
Secure session management and history tracking. 
Low-Resource Optimization. 
Offline-first deployment for areas with limited connectivity. 
Lightweight architecture for mobile and local servers.
